# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot reads a text file which is provided as an argument to the python interpreter and counts the number of words as well as the occurence of each character (case insensitive) to the console.
Usage: python3 main.py <filename.txt>
